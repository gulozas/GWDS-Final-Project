    <h2>Reflective essay</h2>
  <p>For the Graphic & Web Design Studio Design Fundamentals Website Project I was tasked with creating a website on VCS with HTML and CSS stylesheets and then host it through GitHub. On this website I am tasked with showing the means and skills I have learned through completing the coding sheets by creating a structured and accessible website where I will present my content. The other tasks that are to be presented is the Carp Project, in which I was tasked with creating a poster for a girls only skate clinic, the Typographic task, which included me researching the 8 typographic systems and then creating a layout with information describing them based on what I found, this reflective essay that highlights me experience and progress in the assignment as a whole and lasty evidence proving I completed the provided coding sheets. </p>

  <p>When it comes to the coding sheets and overall creation of my website I found that the coding sheets were very intuitive and easy to work through whilst retaining the information I was learning. Due to this I found that completing the coding sheets was not boring or a difficult task and was a rather useful means of remembering previously learnt VCS features and understanding how to improve and add more complex newer features. Something I had not personally used was flexboxes which I was glad to learn as I found they were great to use when creating my website. Creating the website was not too difficult however a personal evaluation was that it would've been better if I worked on it in small consistent sessions rather than an occasional sit down as it meant I could not consistently evaluate my webpage and improve it as sometimes new ideas I had would take too long to implement or would mean deleting large chunks of already existing code. However, other than that the creation of my webpage was a pleasant task as my previous knowledge allowed me to quickly make a basic navigational webpage which I then filled with my work using what was learnt on the coding sheets </p>

  <p>The CARP project was personally my favorite aspect of the assignment as I found it fun learning and experimenting within InDesign as most of what I could think of was fairly easy to implement to an acceptable standard. Additionally, the theme of a skate clinic was a great aspect to the task as it is a fairly cool and stylish theme which meant it was not difficult to think of ideas. </p>
  
  <p>The Typographic systems was not the hardest task in terms of difficulty however it became clear that there was not any clear large sources of information that I could read or reference in order to provide accurate information and descriptions of each system. I decided to include my paragraphs explaining the system within the layout by using that as the text, whilst seeming like a good idea at the time, this lead to fairly bare and simple layouts in cases where I could not find too much information regarding them. </p>

  <p>In Conclusion I would say I enjoyed completing the assignment and believe it taught me a lot of core techniques and information that will help me in my future work. When it comes to my own behaviours It would have been much better if I managed my time with something such as a Gannt chart as I found I wanted to do more but didnâ€™t really have the time to. Lastly a negative aspect of my personal circumstances was the fact I commute. As a result of constant cancellations, strikes and delays, I found I missed lots of in person lessons which I believe would have allow me to better understand the tasks. </p>
