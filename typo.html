      <img src="Axial.jpg" alt="Axial">
      <p>This is Axial the system itself is explained within the image, i chose to execute it in the way i did,
        in order to show the strong focal point and layout of the text along the axis.

      <img src="Bilateral.jpg" alt="Bilateral">
      <p>This is Bilateral the system itself is explained within the image, i chose to execute it in the way i did,
        in order to show the symmetrical layout of this system and how it uses a central column or subject to
    neatly arange typography along th canvas.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="gallery-item">
        <img src="Dilatational.jpg" alt="Dilatational">
        <p>This is Dilatational the system itself is explained within the image, i chose to execute it in the way i did,
            in order show how the typography uses the elements of shapes and other content around it to wrap itself round the central 
        point and attract the eyes of the reader</p>
      </div>
  
     
      <div class="gallery-item">
        <img src="Grid.jpg" alt="Grid">
        <p>This is Grid the system itself is explained within the image, i chose to execute it in the way i did,
            in order portay how the grid system uses ordered and uniform squares / sections to neatly and clearly
        display information and make it easy for the reader to comprehend.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="gallery-item">
        <img src="modular.jpg" alt="modular">
        <p>This is modular the system itself is explained within the image, i chose to execute it in the way i did,
            in order to show how modular typography utilises other elements such as shapes or special characters to 
        recreate the traditional alphabet in a more interesting and unique way</p>
      </div>
  
      
      <div class="gallery-item">
        <img src="Radial.jpg" alt="Radial">
        <p>This is Radial the system itself is explained within the image, i chose to execute it in the way i did,
            in order to show how it extends text off of a radial point in a circular motion to better fill out a page
        and get the readers attention. I think this method would lead to a very unique and interesting poster or leaflet that 
    dosent require an image or other main focus, and can have the text as the main focus</p>
      </div>

      <div class="gallery-item">
        <img src="Random.jpg" alt="Random">
        <p>This is Random the system itself is explained within the image, i chose to execute it in the way i did,
            in order to show how this system uses an unorganised intriguing technique that makes the text look far more interesting.
        This system can fill out a page better and can allow for a cool design however in some cases it can make the information difficult to read and understand.</p>

      <div class="gallery-item">
        <img src="Transitional.jpg" alt="Transitional">
        <p>This is Transitional the system itself is explained within the image, i chose to execute it in the way i did,
            in order show how this typographic system arranges its text in a way that portrays motion and or direction. In my
        example, i attempted to arrange the text in a way that it wouls look similair to wind blowing . </p>
