  <img src="3rdLair.jpg" alt="3rdLair Girls only skate clinic">

  <p>This is my poster for 3rdLair Skatepark & Skateshop that advertises their girls skate clinic. I enjoyed making this as it was a very interisting theme and allowed 
    me to researched different skaters / brands in order to create my own piece of work.
    The main subject of my poster is Lizzie Armanto who is an impressive proffesional Skater. Around my subject i organised
    the required information and layed it out in a way that everyrthing is structured in an aesthetic way and correlates
    with the rest of the poster. I utilised a blues and purples colout scheme throughout with a white colour to
    show important information. I made sure i would consistently reflect on my work and see if i was including each aspect of CARP. I attempted to have contrast by using dark purples and against white and light blue. I also utilised the bright sky and darker shadows cast 
    by the skate rampt to have a better contrast and show more important information in a clearer way. Proximity was used to group relevent information with eachother such as having prices 
    and the website links together and then grouping timing information. Repetition was mainly achieved by following a colour scheme and organising my information in a somewhat consistent way.
    In terms of allingment i arranged information along the sides to keep the main focus on the skater and draw attention to the centre of the poster. 
    I then arranged the crucial information such as pricing in the lower middle so that is one of the first things seen. If this information alongside the focal point interest 
    a client they will then look at the poster in greater detail and see the remaining information regarding dates and links. After completing my poster i added a noise affect over the whole poster to give
    it a vintage look and have it better suit the classic, retro skater mood.

    Here is the reference for the image i used as the base for my poster. <a href="https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/10907224080931354/">Lizzie Armanto</a>
