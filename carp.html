  <p>This is my poster for 3rdLair Skatepark & Skateshop that advertises their girls skate clinic. I enjoyed making this as it was a very interisting theme and allowed 
    me to researched different skaters / brands in order to create my own piece of work.
    The main subject of my poster is Lizzie Armanto who is an impressive proffesional Skater. Around my subject i organised
    the required information and layed it out in a way that everyrthing is structured in an aesthetic way and correlates
    with the rest of the poster. I utilised a blues and purples colout scheme throughout with a white colour to
    show important information. After completing my poster i added a noise affect over the whole posterto give
    it a vintage look and have it better suit the classic, retro skater mood.
